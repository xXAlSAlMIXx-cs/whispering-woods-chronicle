After days of wandering beneath the darkening canopy, Leira reached a glade where the trees grew deathly still and the map’s final symbol pulsed faintly in her hand. She whispered the last ancient phrase, expecting light or truth—but the forest answered with silence. Vines crept slowly around her boots, and the path behind faded into a haze of endless trees. Shadow howled, but even his voice seemed swallowed by the woods. Leira pressed on, heart resolute, but the map dissolved into dust between her fingers. In time, her name became a hushed legend in the village—of the girl who dared to enter the Whispering Woods, and never returned.
